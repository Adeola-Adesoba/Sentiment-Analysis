# Sentiment-Analysis
This project seeks to dive down into the sentiments of people with regards to COVID19, therefore a sentiment analysis of over 1500 tweets obtained from Twitter with the hashtags #COVID19 was carried out
I also created an interactive sentiment polarity plot using Rshiny which will be deployed on shinyapps.i0
